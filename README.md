# Value Vision Training

## "Learning how to draw is learning how to see"

Drawing realistically means mastering the skill of accurately capturing the tonal value of an object. Tonal values indicate light distribution on a surface, defining an object's shape and characteristics. Without correct tonal values, no amount of color can salvage a drawing's realism.

Many struggle with accurately perceiving tonal values, hindering their ability to translate what they see onto paper. Correcting these biases can take years, especially for self-taught artists without access to consistent feedback.

I developed a program that gamifies tonal value training, akin to flashcards. Users match tonal values using a slider, earning points based on accuracy. This provides quick feedback in an engaging format.

The Value Vision Trainer is built in Python using Streamlit for the interface. You can find the program here [insert link]. 


I plan to expand this concept to other aspects of art, such as hue matching, proportion training, and perspective.
