# 👁 Value Vision Training 👁

## "Learning how to draw is learning how to see"

Drawing realistically means mastering the skill of accurately capturing the tonal value of an object. Tonal values indicate light distribution on a surface, defining an object's shape and characteristics. Without correct tonal values, no amount of color can salvage a drawing's realism.

Many struggle with accurately perceiving tonal values, which hinders their ability to translate what they see onto paper. Correcting these biases can take years, especially for self-taught artists without access to consistent feedback from a teacher.

I developed a program that gamifies tonal value training, akin to learning with flashcards. Users match tonal values using a slider, earning points based on accuracy. The closer their estimate is to the real value, the more points are rewarded. In this way the person gets quick feedback in the setting of a fun game.

The Value Vision Trainer is built in Python using Streamlit for the interface. You can find the program here [insert link]. 

I plan to expand this concept to other aspects of art, such as hue matching, proportion training, and perspective.
