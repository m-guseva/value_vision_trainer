# 👁 Value Vision Training 👁

## "Learning how to draw is learning how to see"

Drawing realistically means mastering the skill of accurately capturing the tonal value of an object. Tonal values indicate light distribution on a surface, defining an object's shape and characteristics. Without correct tonal values, no amount of color can salvage a drawing's realism.

Many struggle with accurately perceiving tonal values, which hinders their ability to translate what they see onto paper. Correcting these biases can take years, especially for self-taught artists without access to consistent feedback from a teacher.

👉🏻 I developed a program that gamifies tonal value training, akin to learning with flashcards. The user can upload any image they like into the program to train on. I created an algorithm that finds those areas in the image that are homogenous in value. These areas are selected (see box in the image below) and the user is asked to match the tonal value witha slider earning points based on accuracy. In this way the person gets quick feedback in the setting of an engaging game.

The Value Vision Trainer is built in Python using Streamlit for the interface. You can find the program here [insert link]. 

I plan to expand this concept to other aspects of art, such as hue matching, proportion training, and perspective.
